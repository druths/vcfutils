# Welcome!

Needed to massage a VCF file into a CSV format.  Was very surprised to find that there wasn't a good VCF reader out there... this is not a good VCF reader either, but it does the job if you want export certain things.

To export as csv, try:

```
    python -m vcfutils.app export_csv file.vcf file.csv
```

Contributions are welcome!
